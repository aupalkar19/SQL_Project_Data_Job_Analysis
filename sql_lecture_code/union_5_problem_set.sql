-- UNION and UNION ALL
/*
Problem Statement 1:
Create a unified query that categorizes job postings into two groups: those with salary information (salary_year_avg or salary_hour_avg is not null) and those without it. Each job posting should be listed with its job_id, job_title, and an indicator of whether salary information is provided.

Hint
Use UNION ALL to merge results from two separate queries.
For the first query, filter job postings where either salary field is not null to identify postings with salary information.
For the second query, filter for postings where both salary fields are null to identify postings without salary information.
Include a custom field to indicate the presence or absence of salary information in the output.
When categorizing data, you can create a custom label directly in your query using string literals, such as 'With Salary Info' or 'Without Salary Info'. These literals are manually inserted values that indicate specific characteristics of each record. An example of this is as a new column in the query that doesnâ€™t have salary information, put: 'Without Salary Info' AS salary_info. As the last column in the SELECT statement.

Problem Statement 2:
Retrieve the job id, job title short, job location, job via, skill and skill type for each job posting from the first quarter (January to March). Using a subquery to combine job postings from the first quarter (these tables were created in the Advanced Section - Practice Problem 6 Video) Only include postings with an average yearly salary greater than $70,000.

Hint
Use UNION ALL to combine job postings from January, February, and March into a single dataset.
Apply a LEFT JOIN to include skills information, allowing for job postings without associated skills to be included.
Filter the results to only include job postings with an average yearly salary above $70,000.

/*
Problem Statement 3
Analyze the monthly demand for skills by counting the number of job postings for each skill in the first quarter (January to March), utilizing data from separate tables for each month. Ensure to include skills from all job postings across these months. The tables for the first quarter job postings were created in Practice Problem 6.

Hint
Use UNION ALL to combine job postings from January, February, and March into a consolidated dataset.
Apply the EXTRACT function to obtain the year and month from job posting dates, even though the month will be implicitly known from the source table.
Group the combined results by skill to summarize the total postings for each skill across the first quarter.
Join with the skills dimension table to match skill IDs with skill names.
