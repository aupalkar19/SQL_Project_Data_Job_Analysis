Problem 1:Identify the top 5 skills that are most frequently mentioned in job postings. Use a subquery to find the skill IDs with the highest counts in the skills_job_dim table and then join this result with the skills_dim table to get the skill names.

Focus on creating a subquery that identifies and ranks (ORDER BY in descending order) the top 5 skill IDs by their frequency (COUNT) of mention in job postings.
Then join this subquery with the skills table (skills_dim) to match IDs to skill names.

Problem 2: Problem Statement 
Determine the size category ('Small', 'Medium', or 'Large') for each company by first identifying the number of job postings they have. Use a subquery to calculate the total job postings per company. A company is considered 'Small' if it has less than 10 job postings, 'Medium' if the number of job postings is between 10 and 50, and 'Large' if it has more than 50 job postings. Implement a subquery to aggregate job counts per company before classifying them based on size.

Hint
Aggregate job counts per company in the subquery. This involves grouping by company and counting job postings.
Use this subquery in the FROM clause of your main query.
In the main query, categorize companies based on the aggregated job counts from the subquery with a CASE statement.
The subquery prepares data (counts jobs per company), and the outer query classifies companies based on these counts.

Problem Statement 3 
Your goal is to find the names of companies that have an average salary greater than the overall average salary across all job postings.

You'll need to use two tables: company_dim (for company names) and job_postings_fact (for salary data). The solution requires using subqueries.


Hint:
Think of it as needing three pieces of information:

- The average salary for each company.

- The single overall average salary across all jobs.

- The names of the companies.



You'll build this query from the inside out.



Part 1Ô∏è‚É£ (Inner Subquery): Overall Average.

Goal: Get the single, overall average salary from all job postings.

Action: Write a subquery: SELECT AVG(salary_year_avg) FROM job_postings_fact.

Use: This will go inside your WHERE clause at the very end for comparison.



Part 2Ô∏è‚É£ (Subquery for JOIN): Average Salary Per Company.

Goal: Get the average salary for each company.

Action: Write a subquery that selects company_id and calculates AVG(salary_year_avg). You must GROUP BY company_id here.

Use: This subquery will be treated like a temporary table that you JOIN to company_dim.



Part 3Ô∏è‚É£ (Main Query): Putting It All Together.

Goal: Select company names and filter them based on the averages you calculated.

Action:

Start with SELECT name FROM company_dim.

JOIN your subquery from Part 2 to the company_dim table using company_id. This connects company names to their specific average salaries.

Use a WHERE clause to filter the results, keeping only rows where the company's average salary (from your Part 2 subquery) is greater than the overall average salary (your Part 1 subquery).

/*
Problem Statement: Identify companies with the most diverse (unique) job titles. Use a CTE to count the number of unique job titles per company, then select companies with the highest diversity in job titles.

Hint
- Use a CTE to count the distinct number of job titles for each company.
- After identifying the number of unique job titles per company, join this result with the company_dim table to get the company names.
- Order your final results by the number of unique job titles in descending order to highlight the companies with the highest diversity.
- Limit your results to the top 10 companies. This limit helps focus on the companies with the most significant diversity in job roles. Think about how SQL determines which companies make it into the top 10 when there are ties in the number of unique job titles.

/*
Problem Statement 3
Your goal is to calculate two metrics for each company:

The number of unique skills required for their job postings.

The highest average annual salary among job postings that require at least one skill.

Your final query should return the company name, the count of unique skills, and the highest salary. For companies with no skill-related job postings, the skill count should be 0 and the salary should be null.

Hint
Use two Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to organize your query.

#Ô∏è‚É£ required_skills - 1st CTE:

Goal: To count the distinct skill_id for each company.

Method: Use LEFT JOIN starting from company_dim. This ensures all companies are included in your result, even if they have no job postings or required skills.

üí∞ max_salary - 2nd CTE:

Goal: To find the highest salary_year_avg for each company.

Constraint: This calculation must only include jobs that have at least one skill associated with them. You can achieve this by using INNER JOINs or filtering with a WHERE clause.

Combine the company_dim table with your two CTEs using LEFT JOINs. This will bring together the skill count for all companies and the salary data for those that have skilled positions.
